# Route53 on MountAws

TODO. In the meantime, you can just run `dir` within the `route53` directory and probably find your way around.
Remember that you can often `cd` into objects to find more related objects within. The hiearchy is structured in the following way:

```
-- route53
   |-- hosted-zones
       |-- ZBCRV6P262YK
           |-- my-record.my-hosted-zone.
```
