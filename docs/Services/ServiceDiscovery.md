# ServiceDiscovery on MountAws

TODO. In the meantime, you can just run `dir` within the `service-discovery` directory and probably find your way around.
Remember that you can often `cd` into objects to find more related objects within. The hierarchy looks like this:

```
-- service-discovery
   |-- namespaces
       |-- ns-6wlabhxltbkgtzed # Namespace ID
           |-- srv-qiab623j7y56u55k # Service ID
               |-- 43c24d0863744eeab8f3f320daa9de38 #Instance Id
               |-- baaa0dd464d04843b22231fb6666c41d
```
