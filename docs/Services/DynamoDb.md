# DynamoDB on MountAws

TODO. In the meantime, you can just run `dir` within the `dynamodb` directory and probably find your way around.
Remember that you can often `cd` into objects to find more related objects within. The hierarchy looks like this:

```
-- dynamodb
   |-- tables
       |-- my-table
           |-- item-key-1
           |-- item-key-2
